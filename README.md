# BirthdayApp [Demo](https://bennettstuart.github.io/BirthdayApp)
## The Challenge
To spend a only a handful of hours to implement the features outline below.
- This is a UI challenge, and so it should look and feel great!

### Main features
- A single UI page that shows you today's birthdays, upcoming birthdays (next 2 weeks), and a list view of all the people whose birthdays you're keeping track of.
- For today's birthdays and upcoming, show how old that person is (or will be).
- The list should show the person's name and date of birth, and a human friendly notation of when each person's birthday is to the list (3 days, 5 months, 6 weeks, etc.).
- The ability to add a new birthday to the list, requiring the person's name and date of birth.
- A search option for the list, allowing you to filter by name.
There should be an option to delete birthdays too.

## How to install/run this project:

See a live demo of the project [HERE](https://bennettstuart.github.io/BirthdayApp)!

To run this project:
1. clone this repo
1. `$ npm install serve -g`
1. open the local repo in terminal
1. `$ serve`

## Technical choices:
I chose to use Angular.js for this project becuase it is the javascript framework that I have the most experience with. Allowing me to get on with the nitty gritty of the challenge without having to spend much time in documentation.

I've never really used UI-bootstrap before, despite being closely designed for AngularJS. I chose to use this however because my previous front end development has been primarily designed for cross-platform mobild applications which utilised [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/docs/v1/)


## Trade-offs
Using UI-Bootstrap did eat some time, as I was not used to working with it. However, I was happy that I did manage to get as far as I did by using it, and would look to use it again in the future for sure.

## What would I do differently
Perhaps I would spend more time wireframing and then going for more look and feel over a more bug-free functionality approach.
