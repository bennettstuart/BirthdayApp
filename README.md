# BirthdayApp
## The Challenge
To spend a only a handful of hours to implement the features outline below.
- This is a UI challenge, and so it should look and feel great!

### Main features
- A single UI page that shows you today's birthdays, upcoming birthdays (next 2 weeks), and a list view of all the people whose birthdays you're keeping track of.
- For today's birthdays and upcoming, show how old that person is (or will be).
- The list should show the person's name and date of birth, and a human friendly notation of when each person's birthday is to the list (3 days, 5 months, 6 weeks, etc.).
- The ability to add a new birthday to the list, requiring the person's name and date of birth.
- A search option for the list, allowing you to filter by name.
There should be an option to delete birthdays too.

## How to install/run this project:

See a live demo of the project HERE!

To run this project:

## Technical choices:
I chose to use Angular.js for this project becuase it is the javascript framework that I have the most experience with. Allowing me to get on with the nitty gritty of the challenge without having to spend much time in documentation.

## README file must include:

- How to install and run the project.
- Reasoning behind your technical choices.
- Describe any trade-offs you needed to make and your reasoning.
- Point out anything you might do differently if you had more time.
- Your contact details and any public profiles on developer networks like GitHub, BitBucket, Stack Overflow, etc.

## How the challenge is reviewed

- Well organised and structured code.
- Frequent commits so we can see how your work progressed.
- A good README file that explains succinctly your approach.
- The app/project should work in the way that was explained.
- The code is well written, readable, consistent, maintainable and follows broad best - practice.
- Tests are in place and provide good basic coverage.
- UX is good.
- The technical choices (libraries, patterns) are sensible.
